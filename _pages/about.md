Hi, my name is Zhiyuan Lyu. I am now a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Mathematics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, advised by [Prof. Gary Pui Tung CHOI](https://www.math.cuhk.edu.hk/~ptchoi/). I obtained my  Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2024, advised by Prof. Ronald Lok Ming Lui. Prior to this, I received my master’s and bachelor’s degrees in Computational Mathematics from Harbin Institute of Technology in 2021 and 2019, respectively.
